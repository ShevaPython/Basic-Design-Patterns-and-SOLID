# Studying SOLID Principles and Basic Design Patterns

Welcome to the repository dedicated to studying the SOLID principles and basic design patterns! Here you will find materials, code examples, and tasks to help you deepen your understanding and apply these important concepts in software development.

## What is SOLID?

SOLID is a set of object-oriented design principles created to develop flexible, extensible, and maintainable software systems. Each letter in SOLID represents a separate principle:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

Together, these principles help create more flexible and maintainable systems, making it easier to extend and modify them.

## Basic Design Patterns

Basic design patterns are solution templates that help solve common problems in software design. In this repository, we will explore popular patterns such as:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
- and others

Each pattern will be thoroughly explained with code examples, allowing you to better understand how they work and how to apply them.

## How to Use This Repository
